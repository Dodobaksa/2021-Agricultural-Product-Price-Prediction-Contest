# 2021-Agricultural-Product-Price-Prediction-Contest
This repository contains the code for entries in 2021 Agricultural Product Price Prediction Contest
___
## Description
Agricultural product prices are sensitive to external environments such as war and international oil prices, and rise or fall significantly every year. Since the prices of agricultural products are directly reflected in consumer prices, the government has implemented a policy of supply and demand of agricultural products to catch irregular agricultural prices. If we could only know the prices of agricultural products in the future, we would be able to catch the skyrocketing prices. This project is a medium-term forecasting project that predicts agricultural prices for one, two, and four weeks ahead.
